        <p>I'm Zach Thomas, and you're on my blog! </p>
        <p>
          I started this blog as a way to keep track of a challenge I made to
          myself while sitting at home during the COVID-19 Pandemic back in 2020
          - to write something new every single day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since then its grown to do literally nothing else. It's still the
          start of the blog's life, thanks for coming by to visit in its
          infancy!
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm an Australian, and so all posts are written in Australian English.
          Favourite is not a typo, and neither is Gaol. Regardless, I sometimes
          use 'z' instead of 's' like an American, so please forgive me for
          writing 'realize' on occasion. Emails/Tweets correcting my
          <i> Americanized</i> spelling are encouraged, emails correcting my
          Australian spelling are not.
        </p>
        <p>
          Feedback is welcome, but responses are not prompt. I promise I read
          everything that is sent to me, and I'll get back to you eventually.
        </p>
