I recently had the great pleasure of watching a number of films in the span of a 
month with strong religious undertones, that were also brilliant movies in their 
own right. Prompted by my recent experience I made a relatively innocent Google
search "Best Christian Movies". Boy was I disappointed. 

It seems to me that every "top 24 best Christian films" list on the internet 
is a horrible collection of c-grade or b-grade cinema with awful acting and 
even worse screenplays. The more G rated and devoid of any meaning or purpose,
apparently, the better. The higher up the ranking, the less complex and 
challenging the film.

Incensed by this I decided to make it a mission to watch as many films as 
possible driven by Christian themes, and then make my own list. The list 
contains mature films, children's animations, Palm D'Or nominees, and action 
films. If it's a good film it can make the list, so if there's some genres or
themes you would prefer to avoid, do your own research accordingly. 

I'll regularly edit this post as I watch more films I believe to be worthy of a 
recommendation. Feel free to ship me suggestions of films you think I ought to 
watch.

2. It's A Wonderful Life *(1946)*
3. A Man For All Seasons *(1966)*
