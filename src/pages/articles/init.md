This is my first blog post. Why are you reading this? Seems like you could find
better things to do with your day to be honest.

I started this blog to keep myself accountable to a personal challenge - write
something new every day. There were a few rules:

1. It can't be for work, it needs to be a unique creative thought.
2. The writing needs to be substantive.
3. The writing doesn't need to be complete, but it needs to be a meaningful
   contribution to completing a larger work. That is to say, if I decide to write
   a novel, I don't need to complete it in one day - but I do need to complete a
   meaningful contribution to the novel to count it as that days writing.
4. Editing does not count, even if the editing requires a significant amount
   of new writing. Editing is not the same creative exercise as writing something
   new from scratch.

I came up with this challenge to keep myself productive during the COVID-19
Pandemic. Of course almost as soon as I issued this challenge the lockdown was
lifted and I was back to work, so this challenge didn't quite work out how I
expected it too. Nonetheless the blog (and the site around it) has survived, so
I guess I did achieve something.

**Note: this is not the original blog post, nor the original site.**
